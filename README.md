# LAML
Lightweight API Management Layer provides a framework that allows you to create API proxies wrapping your backend APIs or Micro Services.


## Goal

- allow you to create API proxies during runtime
- let you create reuseable filters such as API key validation, caching, traffic management, logging etc that can be added 
to different request and response flows

## Status

I won't have time to work on this for a while so thought I will put it out there for other to use, update, improve etc. 
The code is at quite an early stage with a lot of features missing or areas that can be improved before being used in a proper 
production environment.
