# LAML
Lightweight API Management Layer provides a framework that allows you to create API proxies wrapping your backend APIs or Micro Services.

## Goal

- Allow you to create and run API proxies during runtime, an API proxy is a wrapper round a backend endpoint.
- Let you create reusable filters such as API key validation, security, caching, traffic management, logging, mediation etc that can be added 
to different request and response flows.

## Status

I won't have time to work on this for a while so thought I will put it out there for other to use, update, improve, build on etc. 
The code is at quite an early stage with a lot of features missing or areas that can be improved before being used in a proper 
production environment. However the main flow is there where you can create an API proxy round an endpoint and hit it.

## To Run
